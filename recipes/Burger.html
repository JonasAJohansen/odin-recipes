                    <h3>How to Make Basic Beef Burger Patties</h3>
                    <p>Nothing says summer quite like a juicy grilled burger. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make these top-rated burger patties:</p>
                    <p>Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Then, add the ground beef and bread crumbs before forming the mixture into ¾-inch patties. Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for six to eight minutes per side.</p>
                    <p>Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before serving, and you're ready to go. Top with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How to Store Beef Burgers</h3>
                    <p>Cooked beef burgers can be safely refrigerated for three to four days. Make sure to promptly chill after cooking in an airtight container to lengthen shelf life.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Can I Freeze Basic Beef Burgers?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, you can freeze cooked burger patties for up to four months. Wrap the burgers in foil individually to discourage sticking before labeling and placing them in a freezer-safe bag.</p>
