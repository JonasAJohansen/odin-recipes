                    <h1>Description:</h1>
                    <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How to Roll Out Pizza Dough</h3>
                    <p>Stretching pizza dough is the most hands-on part of the pizza crust-making process. It takes a little practice, but it's as easy as pie (pun intended). To shape the dough:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature</h3>
                    <p>After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 5 minutes. 
                        This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Prepare Your Surface With Oil</h3>
                    <p>You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. 
                        This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. 
                        Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. 
                        This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Shape the Dough</h3>
                    <p>You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. 
                        Stretch it in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. 
                        No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. 
                        Working it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about ⅓-inch thick. 
                        If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and toppings.</p>

                            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
